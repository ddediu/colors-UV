# Data and code accompanying "Environment and culture shape both the colour lexicon and the genetics of colour perception"

This repository contains all the data and code needed to reproduce the plots and analyses reported in the paper *Environment and culture shape both the colour lexicon and the genetics of colour perception* by M. Josserand, E. Meeussen, A. Majid, and D. Dediu

Our code and data are released under the *GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL) v3* (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) and *Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License* (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0), but the various datasets that we use are governed by their respective licenses (described in the `ReadMe.md` document in the `input_files` folder of the project).

The full analysis report, resulting from running the scripts, was compressed as `colors-UV.html.zip` to reduce its file size.

Please note that, as some techniques involve pseudo-random numbers and may depend on the particular libraries and software platform used, there may be minute differences in the results obtained when re-running these analyses.
