# Information about the 3rd party data used

This document contains various information about the 3rd party data contained in this folder, in alphabetic order, sub-folders first (more details can also be found in the `00_preprocess_data.R` script).

- folder `openstreet` contains the primary data from OpenStreetMap (http://openstreetmapdata.com/), the "Reduced waterbodies as raster masks" (http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/water-reduced-raster), which seems to no longer be available for download separately as of July 2020, but we include here, for reproducibility, the original data as downloaded in March 2018 by Dan Dediu. These data "[...] is open data, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF)" as described at https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.

- folder `toms_nasa_uv` contains the UVB data from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's "New UV Irradiance and Exposure Data Product" TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer; http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/ery_uv/) available in raw format at: http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/ery_uv/new_uv/. Unfortunately, as of July 2020, this data is not longer available online (seems to have been repackaged as per https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datacollection/TOMSEPL3mery_008.html), but we provide the originally processed data for reproducibility. At the time the data was collected, it was freely available, presumably under a license similar to that described at https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-information-policy/ ("[...] NASA promotes the full and open sharing of all data with the research and applications communities, private industry, academia, and the general public.").

- folder `wc5` contains the raw World Clim (https://www.worldclim.org/) data as provided by the `R`'s `raster` package (actual code: `getData('worldclim', var='bio', res=5)`), cached here to avoid extra downloads and ensure future replicability (see the cautionary tales above). WorldClim 1.4 is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (https://www.worldclim.org/data/v1.4/worldclim14.html).

- individual files in the `input_files` folder:

  - `data_climate.tsv`: the pre-processed World Clim climate and ecology data as a TAB-separated file: governed by the same license as the raw World Clim data (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License)
  
  - `data_colors.csv`: this is TAB-separated file contaning the color data originally collected and curated for this project by Emma Meeussen, and furter checked, cleaned and extended by Mathilde Josserand; it is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
  
  - `data_dist2water.tsv`: this is a TAB-separated file containing the distance to the closest large body of water from each language considered here, derived from the pre-processed OpenStreetMap data; governed by the same license as the OpenStreetMap data (Open Data Commons Open Database License).
  
  - `data_elevation.tsv`:  this is a TAB-separated file containing the elevation of each language used here, derived from the Mapzen elevation data, currently (July 2020) still available on https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/ using the `elevatr` package in `R` to obtain it (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elevatr/vignettes/introduction_to_elevatr.html#get_raster_elevation_data). The  Mapzen data is a complex dataset built on several projects and sources, and is governed by their respective licenses; the data is Â© Mapzen (https://www.mapzen.com/rights), OpenStreetMap (https://openstreetmap.org/copyright), and others (https://www.mapzen.com/rights/#services-and-data-sources); please also see https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/attribution.md specifically for the elevation data. Thus, the `data_elevation.tsv` inherits the same attribution requirements as the Mapzen data and is (tentatively) released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License provided those attributions are respected.
  
  - `data_genetics.tsv`: is a TAB-separated file containing the first 10 dimensions of the MDS (Multi-dimensional scaling) applied to the genetic distances between the populations contaiend in the file `distmat_gen_ult.csv` (see below); is releaded here under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License provided the original sources are acknowledged..
  
  - `data_humidity.tsv`: is a TAB-separated file containing the humidity data pre-processed from the NOAA website (http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.CDAS-1/.MONTHLY/.Diagnostic/.above_ground/.qa/datafiles.html); the pre-processing was helped by the `R` packages `ncdf4` and `raster`. The original data (http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.CDAS-1/.MONTHLY/.Diagnostic/.above_ground/.qa/data.nc) was cached in the file `noaa-humidity.nc` to ensure replicability; these data seem to be freely available, but we could not track down the specific license; therefore, we release these under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License provided the original sources are acknowledged.
  
  - `data_UV_incidence.tsv`: is a TAB-separated file containing the pre-processed UV-B data from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's "New UV Irradiance and Exposure Data Product" TOMS (see above folder `toms_nasa_uv`); in the spirit of the apparent opennes ethos of its original source, it is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License provided those attributions are respected.
  
  - `distmat_gen_ult.csv`: is a TAB-separated representation of the genetic distances matrix between the populations considered here, as described in the "Appendix I. Distance matrices" of the full analysis report (the `Rmarkdown` script); it was constructed by Mathilde Josserand from the primary data in ALFRED (https://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/index.asp) and FROG-kb (http://frog.med.yale.edu/FrogKB/), and is releaded here under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License provided the original sources are acknowledged.
  
  - `noaa-humidity.nc`: cached humidity data pre-processed from the NOAA website (http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.CDAS-1/.MONTHLY/.Diagnostic/.above_ground/.qa/data.nc), as described above (see `data_humidity.tsv`); released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License provided the original sources are acknowledged.
